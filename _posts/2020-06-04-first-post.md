I've always wanted to learn how to program, in order to build fast and beautiful software. But I only just started my programming journey one month ago. The problem is that when you want to build something, be it a song, a program, or any creative endeavour, and you have nothing under your belt to make your vision a reality, starting can be really tough.

But last month, I watched Pieter Level's [Turning Side Projects into Profitable Startups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6reLWfFNer0&vl=en), and it clicked. He basically said that anything that you want to learn can be learned online, for free. After watching this video, I decided that I was going to learn how to program by creating my first app: [Lijn](https://github.com/bengrina/Lijn).

I love reading Bande Dessinées, since my discovery of Tintin at age 6. This hobby of mine motivated me to develop Lijn, because, to my knowledge, no app on the App Store presents Bandes Dessinées in a simple but elegant way. Armed of my basic understanding of programming concepts, I designed some mockups on Sketch and tried to reproduce them using Swift + Swiftui. I loved doing this, because it was really easy to make your concept a reality.

But soon, I was facing big (for me) hurdles: I had to learn how to use a database, how to parse XML... Moreover, everytime I add something to my app, I discover that there is still a lot to implement: I have to learn about Grand Central Dispach, Filesystems, APIs... Fortunately, I'm not in a rush and I actually enjoy the learning experience.

When Lijn is production ready, I plan to release it to the App Store, while still open sourcing it. I hope to release an app that's as fast and beautiful as [NetNewsWire](http://netnewswireapp.com/).

To keep my head out of the water, I use a shared [Kanban Board](https://www.notion.so/81e708846e5c4bc2a5afddb66ae256a6?v=2401cf6544d14d49b37b9ddba2ad5e16). If you see something that shouldn't be there, or that I've made a mistake somewhere, don't hesitate to email me!
