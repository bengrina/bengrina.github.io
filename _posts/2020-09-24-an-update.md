It's been nearly two months since I've committed anything to [Lijn](https://github.com/bengrina/Lijn). I need to get back on track in order to have something to publish to the App Store before the end of the year. I'm nearly there for the most basic functionalities: PDF support is quasi-perfect thanks to **PDFKit**, and my **Realm** database syncs quite well with my library view.

The issue that's been holding me back for months is CBZ support. As a CBZ comic is simply a ZIP file containing images, it should be quite trivial to display it. But since I want a rather clean implementation (No  cache full of decompressed comics, no big CPU or battery drain), devising a strategy to do it well has been quite challenging. I've decided to decompress the comic in a background thread, and displaying the images from an array to which my view will subscribe. And as the reader will progress in the comic, i'll delete the n-4th image from the array, in order to keep everything smooth, and not keep everything in ram.

I hope that a somewhat usable alpha will be available in two to three months. I'll have to juggle between Lijn, studying for my law degree, and applying to LLMs, but at least I won't be bored!
